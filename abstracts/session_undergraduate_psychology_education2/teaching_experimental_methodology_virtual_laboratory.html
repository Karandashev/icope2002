<p>The training in experimental methodology is a main topic in teaching psychology. With the objective to experience the logic of experimental research, students are asked to conduct experiments in a experimental laboratory by taking the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create hypotheses</li>
  <li>choose and implement experimental treatments</li>
  <li>assign participants according to experimental design principles</li>
  <li>write appropriate instructions</li>
  <li>register experimental data</li>
  <li>analyze data by means of both descriptive and inferential statistics</li>
  <li>integrate experimental results in theoretical contexts</li>
  <li>write reports</li>
  <li>present findings</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of training is very expensive; especially costs for rooms and equipment are high. The concept of the virtual experimental laboratory Lab.OR is presented as an economic alternative. This web-based laboratory is designed as a learning-environment which facilitates students to take the same steps in experimental research as in a classic lab. Furthermore, Lab.OR offers all features of an interface for online-research. The technical bases are presented, experiences in using Lab.OR are reported, possibilities and limits of using virtual labs in teaching experimental psychology are discussed.</p>
