<p>Directorate: Programs and Opportunities for International Cooperation
This poster will list and describe programs addressing the teaching of
psychology that are sponsored by the Society for the Teaching of Psychology
(Division 2 of the American Psychological Association) and by the Education
Directorate of the American Psychological Association. For example, each
group sponsors a web site that provides access to useful materials
supporting the teaching of psychology. In the case of the Society for the
Teaching of Psychology, that web address is www.teachpsych.org. In the
case of the APA Education Directorate, that web address is www.apa.org/ed/.
The Society for the Teaching of Psychology also publishes an outstanding
journal on teaching, Teaching of Psychology, makes teaching-related
materials available through its Office of Teaching Resources in Psychology,
offers funding for innovative teaching projects through its Instructional
Resource Awards program, and sponsors annual teaching awards. The APA
Education Directorate was the major sponsor of the Psychology Partnerships
Project and the recent Education Leadership Conference. Both the Society
for the Teaching of Psychology and the APA Education Directorate are eager
to cooperate with teachers of psychology throughout the world, and a goal
of this poster is to identify and encourage opportunities for that
cooperation</p>
